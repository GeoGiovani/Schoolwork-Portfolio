This file showcases the work that I alone contributed to the S.F.U. - Special 
Fortification Unit game. This means that every line of code in this folder 
was written by me originally. 

I also helped write the rest of the code that makes up the project, but as 
this was a group project, it is not all mine, which is why I it is not 
displayed here.
